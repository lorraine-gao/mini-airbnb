1. In our UI design, we've defined numerous components and aligned them as much as possible to enhance aesthetics and readability.

2. Throughout the project, we predominantly use Typography to edit text content. This standardizes and unifies the presentation of the font content, achieving a more visually appealing UI.

3. For color selection, the website predominantly features a blue and white palette. We've extensively used blue, with subtle adjustments in some areas to achieve a harmonious overall color scheme.

4. We use larger fonts and brighter colors to highlight key sections of the pages, aiding users in quickly locating essential information.

5. In terms of visual hierarchy, our design emphasizes crucial information in the header and details in image cards within detail panels, assisting users in rapidly identifying relevant information.

6. Arrow elements are employed to indicate affordances, guiding users toward specific functionalities within the site.

7. We've eliminated extraneous designs on the pages to ensure that information and functionality are presented in a concise and clear manner.

8. All pages in the project are designed with a consistent color and font style, offering a high level of uniformity and user-friendliness to visitors.
