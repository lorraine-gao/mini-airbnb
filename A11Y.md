In this project, we adhere to the principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, effectively achieving Level AA compliance.

Perceivable:
1. For images and similar non-text content, we have implemented appropriate alternative text (alt text), such as the current item's name. This ensures that non-text content can be accessed in alternative forms, like auditory reading.
2. In terms of distinguishability, we meticulously adjusted the color contrast on our web pages. This resulted in pages with excellent distinguishability, enhancing visual clarity and readability.

Operable:
1. Acknowledging users who may find using a mouse inconvenient, our web page interactions are fully keyboard navigable. Users can cycle through components using the tab key and make selections using the enter key.
2. With extra considerations in mind, we adopted a clean and simple page style to prevent discomfort among users. This approach aligns with a broad range of aesthetic preferences, ensuring a comfortable browsing experience.

Understandable:
1. We designed our web pages with predictable navigation logic. Unless there are necessary page changes, we avoid altering the underlying HTML structure, ensuring that users do not encounter unexpected changes during their visit.
2. Error messages conveyed to the frontend users are concise to avoid overwhelming users, particularly those who rely on auditory feedback.

Robust:
1. Our web architecture is built with cross-compatibility in mind, ensuring functionality across a wide range of browsers and devices. This is crucial for creating a universally accessible web experience.
2. We rigorously test our website with various assistive technologies, to ensure that all features remain accessible and functional for users with diverse needs.
