Below that is second path of ui testing:

1.vistor the default page and then login account
2.click the properthy which was bookid before by this account
3.write a review and rate is, then submit review
4.logout this account

Reason to design this path:
Except post a new property or publish a property in the happy path, it is more likely to act as a hoster to manager.
We'd like to test the user interaction so choose to design the path as a normal user who just booked a property before and didnt post any property in this app, and he always likes to give review for items.
This path cover he review and rating system, which is a key part of influencing user experience and decision-making, especially in applications that involve selecting services or products.
