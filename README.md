#### Running tests

Tests must be run from inside the `frontend` folder by running `npm run test`.

You are welcome to modify the `npm run test` command by updating the `test` script inside `frontend/package.json`. For example, if you would like to run standard react testing alongside cypress UI tests you can use `react-scripts test —watchAll=false && npm run cypress open` and if you've used cypress for both component and happy path test, then you can replace that line with `cypress open`.

### The Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies necessary to run the ReactJS app. Then run `npm start` to start the ReactJS app.

### The Backend

You are prohibited from modifying the backend. No work needs to be done on the backend. It's provided to you simply to power your frontend.

The backend server exists in your individual repository. After you clone this repo, you must run `npm install` in `backend` directory once.

To run the backend server, simply run `npm start` in the `backend` directory. This will start the backend.

To view the API interface for the backend you can navigate to the base URL of the backend (e.g. `http://localhost:5005`). This will list all of the HTTP routes that you can interact with.

Your backend is persistent in terms of data storage. That means the data will remain even after your express server process stops running. If you want to reset the data in the backend to the original starting state, you can run `npm run reset` in the backend directory. If you want to make a copy of the backend data (e.g. for a backup) then simply copy `database.json`. If you want to start with an empty database, you can run `npm run clear` in the backend directory.

Once the backend has started, you can view the API documentation by navigating to `http://localhost:[port]` in a web browser.

The port that the backend runs on (and that the frontend can use) is specified in `frontend/src/config.js`. You can change the port in this file. This file exists so that your frontend knows what port to use when talking to the backend.
